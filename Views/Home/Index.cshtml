    <h2>What is a BCI?</h2>
    <p>A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. BCIs are often used to assist, augment, or repair human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Applications of BCI</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Medical rehabilitation for stroke or paralysis patients</li>
        <li>Assistive technology for communication (e.g., text generation via brain signals)</li>
        <li>Gaming and immersive virtual reality</li>
        <li>Neuroscience research and cognitive training</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
    <p>BCIs represent a cutting-edge frontier in technology and neuroscience. They have the potential to radically improve quality of life, especially for individuals with physical disabilities, and may eventually revolutionize how we interact with computers and the world.</p>
